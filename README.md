# ObjectDetector
This detector will find elementary shapes on a background.
The goal of the project was to combine classical computer vision techniques with neural networks to detect multiple
objects in a scene.

### Motivation
It is a basic precursor to the more advanced techniques I am using for plaque recognition for Alzheimer's disease.
From that viewpoint it is important that this machine detects with good accuracy the different objects when sparsely located around
the scene (overlapping plaques are dealt with differently).

#Usage
The ShapeCreator class



#Acknowledgements
The setup (and only the setup) of this problem is similar to
* [Object detection with neural networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-with-neural-networks-a4e2c46b4491) 

This code, along with the method of solving the problem, was created by myself.
